# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Homework

## Well Hello There
### There must be a pupose to all this..
oh, there is. The purpose was to provide visual data in order to determine affordability for each neighborhood. Based on the information obtained by PyBer via CSV fil the data has been processed into a summary datafram and a visual dataframe!

### Let's see that Visual Data
You got it!

![This is an image](https://github.com/DJacobs86/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

this beautiful and colorful chart shows the money made by the service over a period of time. Januaray through May urban cities were king, in second was suburia, followed by the rural cities.

### Wrap it up
Urban cities reign supreme generating the most revune. Customers in Urban cities pay less for their rides so the drivers earn less per ride. In rural areas, unfortunatley face more expensive fares than the other two cities. Sad really.

### Suggestions & Recommendations

- A little extra data could go a long way here. Instead of just focusing on the Januaray - May, the entire year could provide some insights into more trends.
* Perhaps conduct a study to see if there is enough demand in rural cities to justify hiring more drivers
